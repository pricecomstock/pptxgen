        <i>Forgot My Slides</i> is a procedural PowerPoint generator by

      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        It generates random powerpoints. You can play Powerpoint Karaoke with
        these. Just start a presentation and improvise like you know what you're
        doing!

      <h1>Is this safe for my workplace?</h1>
      <p>
        Probably not, maybe someday! I haven't intentionally filled it with NSFW
        content but I do pull random content and images from places like
        Wikipedia and Reddit and those are pretty unpredictable.

      <h1>How are the slides generated?</h1>
      <p>
        I've written a
        <a href="https://pricecomstock.com/2019/04/09/powerpoint-generator.html"

      <p>
        But the TL;DR is: Random images and text are pulled from Reddit and
        Wikipedia for things like slide titles and bullet points. I also use
        <a href="http://tracery.io">Tracery</a> and a big ol'
        <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora"
          >categorized dictionary of words</a
        >
        to generate text for things that need more structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also use a few huge sets of strings I've found like "every Jeopardy
        category ever."
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> to generate and
        display charts.
