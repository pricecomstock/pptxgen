        This is basically just a list of improv tips but here you go:
      </h1>
      <h3>Keep things moving!</h3>
      <p>
        You probably want to stick with one of the shorter slideshow options.
        Better to have the presentation end while it's still fun than go on too
        long!
      </p>
      <p>
        Expect each slide count option to take about that many minutes.
        Questions take longer and probably aren't as fun as you think, so maybe
        only allow one or two per speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're presenting, don't feel like you need to get caught up
        explaining every single thing on every slide! Sometimes a quick nod to a
        piece of info is enough!
      </p>

      <h3>Don't bail, make it work!</h3>
      <p>
        This is mostly an exercise in justifying. When in doubt, add confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying something like "I don't know why this is in here," should be a
        last resort. It's much more fun if you act like you planned this and
        come up with a reason (no need for it to be good) why this chart about
        kitten birth rates is, in fact, related to your overall presentation on
        the history of Australia.*
      </p>
      <p>
        Get abstract! Try making a curveball slide into an anecdote or an
        analogy! The audience wants you to succeed and will eat up any effort to
        make it make sense.
      </p>

      <h3>Weave it all together!</h3>
      <p>
        Try to make everything related to the topic. Even if it's very loose,
        remember the context of your presentation!
      </p>
      <p>
        Make callbacks! As you go through the presentation, you'll introduce
        more details that you can later reference!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use your character!</strong> The first slide after the title is
        a bio slide! If you have a pet pig, maybe you tell a story about it
        later. If you have a master's degree in horror movies, maybe you get a
        lot of your points across with analogies to <i>The Exorcist</i>.
      </p>
      <h3>Be supportive as an audience!</h3>
      <p>Laugh generously!</p>
      <p>
        These slides aren't being handcrafted. They are <i>not</i> easy to
        present with, especially if you don't have improv experience! Remember,
        failure is okay, fun, and cool! There's always next time!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're asking questions, you want to ask questions that set the
        speaker up for something fun. These slides don't make any sense, you
        aren't trying to trap them!
      </p>
      <p>If not everyone wants to try, that's ok!</p>

        * If you're wondering, it's because the British "send prisoners across
        the ocean" fund came out of the "cat midwife" fund.
